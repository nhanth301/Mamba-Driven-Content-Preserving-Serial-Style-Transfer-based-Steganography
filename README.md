# ðŸŒ€ MambaStegaFormer: Serial Style Transfer with Content Steganography and Hybrid Mamba-Transformer
MambaStegaFormer is a deep learning framework designed for serial style transfer â€” the ability to apply multiple artistic styles sequentially â€” while preserving the semantic content of the original image. This is achieved through a hybrid architecture that combines the efficiency of Mamba (state space models) with the expressive power of Transformers, enhanced by a steganographic mechanism that invisibly encodes content features into stylized outputs.
